## What Kairos Does

Kairos is the **agent + money** layer for crypto copilots: specialists fetch real market structure (prices, headlines, TVL, yields, bridges, perps), an orchestrator keeps answers **grounded in tool output**, and **treasury → agent** flows use **native HSK** on HashKey testnet—with **agent-to-agent (A2A)** demos when multiple specialists coordinate.

**Key differentiators:**
- ✅ **Native HSK micropayments** — Treasury pays agent owners per specialist invocation (when settlement succeeds)
- ✅ **Agent-to-agent (A2A) commerce** — Agents pay each other for sub-tasks
- ✅ **On-chain registry** — Nine agents resolvable from `AgentRegistry` + env fallbacks
- ✅ **Auditable** — Explorer links for successful transfers; receipts API for late hashes
- ✅ **Deterministic routing + Groq** — Tool-first paths for reliability; optional live web index (Tavily / Brave) when API keys are set

**9 specialist agents:**

| Agent | ID | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| Price Oracle | `oracle` | Real-time prices, market cap, ATH via CoinGecko |
| News Scout | `news` | Crypto headlines (aggregated RSS) |
| Yield Optimizer | `yield` | DeFi yields across 500+ protocols |
| Tokenomics Analyzer | `tokenomics` | Supply, unlocks, inflation models |
| Chain Scout | `chain-scout` | HashKey/EVM account facts (balance, nonce, contract detection) |
| Perp Stats | `perp` | Perpetual futures, funding rates, open interest |
| Protocol Stats | `protocol` | TVL, fees, revenue via DeFiLlama |
| Bridge Monitor | `bridges` | Cross-chain bridge volumes |
| DEX Volumes | `dex-volumes` | Top DEX volumes by chain (DeFiLlama) |

## Quick Start (Local)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- A funded HashKey testnet account (treasury)
- MetaMask (or compatible EVM wallet)

### Backend

```bash
cd kairos-backend
cp .env.example .env   # fill in required values
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd kairos-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`, backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`kairos-backend/.env`)

**Required:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key (OpenAI-compatible) |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | Groq model id (default `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) |
| `HASHKEY_TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY` | Treasury private key (0x...) |
| `HASHKEY_RPC_URL` | HashKey testnet RPC (default `https://testnet.hsk.xyz`) |
| `HASHKEY_CHAIN_ID` | `133` |
| `KAIROS_AGENT_REGISTRY_EVM_ADDRESS` | Deployed `AgentRegistry` address |
| `KAIROS_SPENDING_POLICY_EVM_ADDRESS` | Deployed `SpendingPolicy` address (optional) |
| `KAIROS_SPENDING_POLICY_STRICT` | `1` = block payout if `canSpend` reverts. Default `0` = still pay (direct treasury transfer) when the policy call reverts — fixes stuck “Confirming” when ABI/policy mismatches. |

**Server config:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | HTTP port |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | _(optional)_ | Comma-separated origins; only enforced when **`STRICT_CORS=1`**. Default CORS reflects any browser `Origin` (good for Vercel + Railway). |

**Agent addresses (EVM) (all 9 required):**

```
ORACLE_EVM_ADDRESS
NEWS_EVM_ADDRESS
YIELD_EVM_ADDRESS
TOKENOMICS_EVM_ADDRESS
PERP_EVM_ADDRESS
CHAIN_SCOUT_EVM_ADDRESS
PROTOCOL_EVM_ADDRESS
BRIDGES_EVM_ADDRESS
DEX_VOLUMES_EVM_ADDRESS
```

**Optional (app degrades gracefully):**

| Variable | Effect if missing |
|---|---|
| `COINGECKO_API_KEY` | Price oracle hits public rate limits |
| `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | No persistent chat history, ratings, or response time tracking |
| `KAIROS_AGENT_REGISTRY_EVM_ADDRESS` | Agent address resolution falls back to env map (payments still work) |
| `KAIROS_SPENDING_POLICY_EVM_ADDRESS` | Spending-policy enforcement for treasury payouts |
| `STRICT_CORS` | Set to `1` to allow only **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** plus `https://*.vercel.app`. If unset, CORS is **permissive** (reflects any `Origin`) — better for hackathon deploys; tighten for real production. |

### Frontend (`kairos-frontend/.env`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | Backend URL |
| `VITE_ADMIN_ADDRESS` | _(empty)_ | Wallet address shown with Admin badge |

---

## Agent Wallet Setup

Kairos uses 9 autonomous **EVM agent wallets**. A helper script deterministically derives them from the treasury key and writes them into `kairos-backend/.env`.

```bash
cd kairos-backend

npx tsx scripts/generate-agent-evm-wallets.ts
```

The script outputs `.env` lines ready to paste. Keep `agent-wallets.json` secret — it contains private keys.

---

## Database Setup (Supabase)

Run `db/schema.sql` once in the Supabase SQL Editor. It creates:
- `chat_sessions` — per-wallet conversation threads
- `chat_messages` — full message history with tx hashes
- `message_ratings` — thumbs up/down per agent (drives ratings)
- `query_logs` — response times per agent (drives live stats)

---

## Deployment

### Backend → Railway

Set all environment variables from the table above in Railway's Variables tab, then connect the `kairos-backend/` directory. `railway.toml` and `Dockerfile` handle the rest.

### Frontend → Vercel / Railway

Set `VITE_API_URL` to your Railway backend URL. `vercel.json` includes SPA rewrite rules.

---

## Payment Architecture

Kairos implements two layers of on-chain payments — both are real HashKey (EVM) transactions, fully auditable.

### Layer 1: Treasury → Agent
Every user query triggers the treasury paying each specialist agent in native **HSK**. The payment fires before the response is returned and the tx hash is embedded in the UI.

```
User query → Orchestrator → Agent A  →  0.01 USDC (treasury → oracle)
                          → Agent B  →  0.01 USDC (treasury → news)
```

### Layer 2: Agent → Agent (A2A Sub-payments)
When multiple agents collaborate on a query, the primary agent pays the sub-agents for their coordination. This is true autonomous agent commerce — agents earn AND spend on-chain.

```
Agent A (oracle) → Agent B (news)  →  0.005 USDC A2A payment
```

Both payment layers are visible in the chat UI as clickable badges linking to HashKey Explorer.

**Payment path:** Treasury (HSK) → Agent wallets (HSK, HashKey testnet)  
**A2A protocol:** Agents hold their own funded wallets and sign transactions autonomously.

## Smart Contracts (EVM)

Two contracts deployed to HashKey testnet:

### 1. Agent Registry

All 9 agents are registered on-chain via `AgentRegistry`.

The contract stores:
- Agent owner address (EVM 0x…)
- Service type (price, news, yield, etc.)
- Per-task price (in wei)
- Reputation score (updated on ratings)
- Tasks completed counter

Contract methods: `registerAgent`, `updateAgent`, `updateReputation`, `getAgent`, `listAgentKeys`

### 2. Spending Policy

Demonstrates **programmable spending constraints** for autonomous agents — a key capability for production agentic systems.

Features:
- Daily spending limits per agent (native HSK)
- Automatic daily reset
- Lifetime spend tracking
- Owner-controlled limit updates

Contract methods: `setDailyLimit`, `getStatus`, `remaining`, `canSpend`, `recordSpend`

The Price Oracle agent has a 10 USDC/day spending limit set as a demo.

---

## Agentic Payments (EVM)

Kairos implements:
- Machine-to-machine payments (A2A transfers)
- Pay-per-use resources (per-agent settlement per query)
- Autonomous wallets (9 agent EOAs)
- Programmable access + limits (registry + spending policy)

---


### Chat Interface
Users ask natural language questions. Agent badges show which specialists responded. Payment badges link directly to HashKey Explorer.

### Dashboard
Per-agent treasury balance, tasks completed, recent activity feed with on-chain receipts. A2A debits/credits displayed with direction indicators.

### Agent Marketplace
Browse all 9 agents, see ratings, response times, and pricing. Connect to view your agent's dashboard.
